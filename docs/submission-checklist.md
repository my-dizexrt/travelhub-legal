# Pinjai — Store submission checklist

**Version 0.1 · 14 Nov 2026 · internal (excluded from Pages).** Not legal advice. Every field that has to be filled in when submitting to App Store Connect and Google Play Console, with where its value comes from.

Status: ✅ ready (value is in the repo) · 🟡 waiting on the team (build or screenshots) · 🔴 **waiting on the owner** (only the owner can do it; ask through PM).

Sources: [store-listing.md](store-listing.md) (listing text and URLs), [store-privacy-labels.md](store-privacy-labels.md) (App Privacy / Data safety), [store-submission-answers.md](store-submission-answers.md) (age rating, export, IARC, audience), [app-review-notes.md](app-review-notes.md) (review notes), [ropa.md](ropa.md).

## ⚠️ Timeline risk: Google Play closed test (owner)
If the Play developer account is a **personal account created after 13 Nov 2023**, Play requires a **closed test with at least 12 testers opted in continuously for 14 days** before production access, and Google's review of the access request "usually takes seven days or less" ([Play Console Help](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/14151465)). For a 21 Dec submission, the closed test should **start by about 30 Nov** with 12+ testers (recruit a few spare). Organization accounts are exempt.

| # | Item | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|

| 0.2 | Google Play developer account + identity verification | 🔴 | One-time fee, paid by the owner. Account type (personal/organization) decides the closed-test rule above |

| 0.5 | App Review contact (first/last name, phone, email) | 🔴 | Apple App Review Information; private, not shown to users |
| 0.6 | Countries/regions to release in | 🔴 decision | Thailand only, or more. **If the EU is included**, Apple's trader status (DSA) needs a decision, and a trader's address/phone are shown publicly |
| 0.7 | Price | ✅ | Free, no in-app purchases |
| 0.8 | Accept the Google Maps Platform terms and keep the DPAs (Supabase, Sentry) | 🔴 | ROPA open item |

| G18 | Countries | 🔴 | Same as 0.6 |

## 3. Final checks before pressing Submit
- Run the live-page check: policy TH/EN, FAQ and delete-account all 200; `/docs/*` 404.
- The store text, privacy answers and policy say the same thing (policy-sync-pr if anything changed).
- Re-run `count-listing.py` if the listing changed.
- If any Phase 2 feature is in the build (Shared, posting, sharing location with friends, ads, an in-app browser), stop: privacy labels, age rating, IARC and policy must be redone first.
